# coderhouse-web-development-project
My project for Coderhouse's Responsive Web Development course

I have been developing a website called "Baby Starter Pack", which would aim to provide an integral solution for new parents to deal with the challenges of caring for a newborn.
The website is in Spanish but the code comments are in English.
